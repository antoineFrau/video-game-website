## Explain how does it work

### src/

`src` folder got 2 main files `App.vue` and `main.js`, they are our main files, `App.vue` is the root file for all the website diferent layout will be push in this `<route-view></route-view>`. `main.js` is our main Vue app, where we configure everything.

Then we have `layouts` a layout is a full page with header, body and footer.
The body of the layout will be fill by `components`.

So the what is a `component` ? a component is a standalone module, which will be reusable everywhere.

In my case I created a `MainContent` coponent where I put other components. Like that I can have a same Layout with `nav` and `footer`, and just can change the mainContent.
Like having a form, or blog (using router).

About the `router` folder it's using vue-router and it's basic.

Finaly `store` able me to add cookie to the website.
